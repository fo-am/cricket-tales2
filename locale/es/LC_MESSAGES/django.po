"In a secret field in Northern Spain, hundreds of cricket burrows are "
"monitored using CCTV. This is the first long-term study on the behaviour of "
"wild insects. By tagging events in the videos, you are contributing directly "
"to research that will show whether crickets have individual personalities."

"The results will tell us whether some crickets are more active in the "
"morning, while others are more active later in the day. This tells us how "
